# Datathon Tutorials

Welcome to [NUS-NUH-MIT Datathon 2019](http://www.nus-datathon.com/)!

We have prepared tutorials to get you started on
1. Using Google's [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) to work on structured data. A couple of comprehensive examples are included to show how to view the datasets, run transformations and analyse them. please go to ["bigquery_tutorial"](https://github.com/nus-mornin-lab/datathon-gcp-2019/tree/master/bigquery_tutorial) directory for more detail.

2. Working with image analysis using google's [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). The tutorial provides detailed instruction on how to load data(tfrecord) from a bucket and run a CNN model using Keras API. MIMIC_CXR dataset was used as an example. please go to ["mimic_cxr"](https://github.com/nus-mornin-lab/datathon-gcp-2019/tree/master/mimic_cxr) directory for more detail.
