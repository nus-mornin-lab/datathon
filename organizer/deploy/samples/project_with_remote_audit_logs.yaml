# Sample template to create three projects: a project for hosting audit-logs
# and two projects for hosting data. The data hosting projects have GCS buckets,
# BigQuery datasets, logging to GCS and BigQuery, and logs-based metrics for
# unexpected access.
#
# Usage:
# 1) Replace all fields with relevant values in (a copy of) this file.
# 2) Run gcloud init
# 3) run ./create_project.py --project_yaml=${NEW_PROJECT_YAML?}
# 4) When prompted, follow the steps to set up a Stackdriver account.
