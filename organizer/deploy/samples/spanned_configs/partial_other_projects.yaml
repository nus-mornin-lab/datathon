# Sample template to create three projects: a project for hosting audit-logs
# and two projects for hosting data. The data hosting projects have GCS buckets,
# BigQuery datasets, logging to GCS and BigQuery, and logs-based metrics for
# unexpected access.

# Actually, span project_with_remote_audit_logs.yaml into 4 files

# Multiple dataset projects can be deployed at once with the one YAML file.
